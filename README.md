# Argo CD Helm Repository

Welcome to the Argo CD Helm Repository! This repository contains Helm charts for deploying and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster using Argo CD.

## Overview

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It allows you to manage Kubernetes resources in a Git repository and automatically synchronize them to your Kubernetes cluster. This repository leverages Helm for templating and packaging Kubernetes applications.

## Installation

1. **Install Argo CD**: Follow the instructions on the [Argo CD Installation Guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).
    
2. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-argocd-helm-repo.git
    cd your-argocd-helm-repo
    ```
    
3. **Create Argo CD applications**: Apply the application definitions in the `argocd-apps` directory:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f argocd-apps/
    ```
    
4. **Add the Helm repository to Argo CD**:
    ```bash
    argocd repo add https://github.com/yourusername/your-argocd-helm-repo.git --type git
    ```

## Usage

Once you have your applications deployed with Argo CD, you can access the Argo CD UI to manage and monitor your applications.

1. **Access the Argo CD UI**:
    ```bash
    # Login to Argo CD
    argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER>
    ```
    
2. **Sync your applications**: Use the UI or CLI to sync your applications to the desired state defined in this repository.
    
3. **Monitor your applications**: View the health and status of your applications from the Argo CD dashboard.

## Monitoring and Logs

You can monitor your Argo CD applications and view logs directly through the Argo CD UI. For additional logging, you can access the Argo CD server logs using:
```bash
kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-server
```
